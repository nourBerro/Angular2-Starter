# Angular2-Starter
Angular 2 starter code with routing enabled 


this project is nothing but angular init files to start building your own application with routing enabled.

to work with this files you need to download all node modules :> _npm install_


then start the lite server via node comand :> _npm start_

you will notice the default url is : http://localhost:3000/ redirected automaticaly to http://localhost:3000/home but you can test another route : http://localhost:3000/login

Thats it.
HAPPY CODING
